# sc_Matlab_toolbox
A toolbox for single cell sequencing data analysis (sc_Matlab_toolbox)
It covers the procedures of sc-RNA data analysis including 1), normalization for cells with a scaling factor (w); 2,filteration for genes which have a lot of missed value in expression matrix; 3), identification of highly variable genes (HVGs); 4) cluering and visualization with t-SNE; and 5) identify the differential expression genes (DEGs).
In the future, something more will be added.
