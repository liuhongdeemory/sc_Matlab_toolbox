# sc_Matlab_toolbox
A toolbox for single cell sequencing data analysis (sc_Matlab_toolbox).
It covers the procedures of sc-RNA data analysis including 1), normalization for cells with a scaling factor (TMM baised w); 2,filteration for genes which have a lot of missed value in expression matrix; 3), identification of highly variable genes (HVGs); 4) clustering and visualization with t-SNE; and 5) identify the differential expression genes (DEGs) with three kinds of test (NB, Poisson, KW-test).
In the future, more will be added.
